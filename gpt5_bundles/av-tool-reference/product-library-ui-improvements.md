# Product Library UI Improvements

## Summary
This document outlines the UI improvements made to the Product Library page based on user feedback and requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Import Button from Middle of Screen
**File:** `src/components/product-library/product-library.tsx`
- **Issue:** Import button was displayed in the middle of the screen when no search filters were applied
- **Solution:** Removed the import button from the empty state, keeping only the import button in the top right corner
- **Impact:** Cleaner, less cluttered interface that directs users to the main import functionality

### 2. Centered Column Headers and Applied Montserrat Font
**File:** `src/components/product-library/product-library.tsx`
- **Issue:** Column headers were left-aligned and not using the brand font
- **Solution:** 
  - Updated `SortableHeader` component to center content with `text-center` and `justify-center`
  - Added `font-montserrat` class to all headers
  - Updated non-sortable headers (Image, Actions) to be centered
  - Applied Montserrat font to all table cells
- **Impact:** Consistent typography and better visual alignment throughout the table

### 3. Added Image Preview to Edit Product Modal
**File:** `src/components/product-library/edit-product-modal.tsx`
- **Issue:** No visual preview of product image when editing
- **Solution:**
  - Expanded modal to `max-w-4xl` to accommodate image preview
  - Added 3-column grid layout (1 column for image, 2 columns for form)
  - Implemented image preview with fallback for broken/missing images
  - Used sticky positioning for image preview
- **Impact:** Better user experience when editing products with visual confirmation

### 4. Added Secondary and Tertiary Distributor Fields
**File:** `src/components/product-library/edit-product-modal.tsx`
- **Issue:** Only Primary Distributor field was available in edit modal
- **Solution:**
  - Extended `Product` interface to include `secondary_distributor` and `tertiary_distributor`
  - Updated `FormData` interface and form state management
  - Added input fields for Secondary and Tertiary Distributors in a 2-column grid
  - Updated form submission to handle new distributor fields
- **Impact:** Complete distributor information management capability

### 5. Fixed "Categories" Text Display
**Files:** 
- `src/components/csv/streamlined-csv-import.tsx`
- `src/components/csv/import-preview.tsx`
- **Issue:** "Categories" text was being cut off in CSV import preview
- **Solution:**
  - Added `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent text wrapping
  - Added `min-w-[120px]` to ensure adequate container width
  - Ensured proper centering with consistent styling
- **Impact:** Clear, untruncated display of category counts during import

## Technical Details
