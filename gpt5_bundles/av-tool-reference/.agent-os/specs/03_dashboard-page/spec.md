# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Protected Dashboard Page with Sidebar
> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Completed

## Overview

This spec outlines the creation of a basic, protected dashboard page that will serve as the main application layout. The primary goal is to establish the core UI structure, including a persistent sidebar for navigation, and to serve as a secure landing area for authenticated users. This will also verify that the login and session management flows are working correctly.

## User Stories

- As a logged-in user, I want to see a consistent navigation sidebar on the left so I can easily move between different sections of the application.
- As a logged-in user, I want to see a main content area that will eventually hold the dashboard, so I know I have logged in successfully.
- As an unauthenticated user, I want to be prevented from seeing the application layout, so that I understand the page is secure.

## Spec Scope

1.  **Create a Reusable Layout Component:** Build a new component that includes a static sidebar on the left and a main content area on the right.
2.  **Create a Placeholder Dashboard:** The main content area should display a simple placeholder message: "Dashboard Coming Soon", as specified in the page brief.
3.  **Populate Sidebar:** The sidebar will contain placeholder links for future pages (e.g., "Dashboard", "Projects", "Settings").
4.  **Display User Information:** The layout should show the logged-in user's email and a "Sign Out" button, likely in the sidebar or a header.
5.  **Protect the Route:** The entire application layout will be protected by the existing middleware, redirecting unauthenticated users to `/login`.

## Out of Scope

-   Any actual dashboard functionality, widgets, or data visualization.
-   Making the sidebar links functional. They will be placeholders for now.

## Expected Deliverable

1.  A new, persistent layout is visible after logging in.
2.  The layout contains a sidebar on the left and a main content area on the right.
3.  The main content area displays "Dashboard Coming Soon".
4.  The layout displays the current user's email and a functioning sign-out button.
5.  The entire layout is protected and only visible to authenticated users.
