## Tasks

- [x] 1. **Create Reusable Layout and Sidebar Components**
    - [x] 1.1 Create a new component directory: `src/components/layout`.
    - [x] 1.2 Create a `Sidebar` component (`src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`) with placeholder navigation links (e.g., Dashboard, Projects, Settings) and a Sign Out button.
    - [x] 1.3 Create a main `AppLayout` component (`src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`) that arranges the `Sidebar` on the left and reserves a content area on the right. This component will also fetch and display the user's email.
    - [x] 1.4 **Test:** Manually verify that the layout components render without errors (functionality will be tested later).

- [x] 2. **Integrate Layout and Create Placeholder Page**
    - [x] 2.1 Update the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) to use the new `AppLayout` for all authenticated routes.
    - [x] 2.2 Update the root page (`src/app/page.tsx`) to be a simple server component that displays the "Dashboard Coming Soon" message within the `AppLayout`.
    - [x] 2.3 Ensure the Sign Out button in the sidebar is wired up to call `supabase.auth.signOut()` and redirect to `/login`.
    - [x] 2.4 **Test:** Log in and verify you see the new layout with the sidebar and the "Dashboard Coming Soon" message. Test the sign-out button.

- [x] 3. **Verify Route Protection**
    - [x] 3.1 Resolved middleware conflicts that were preventing proper routing. Client-side protection remains active in `AppLayout`.
    - [x] 3.2 **Test:** Complete end-to-end authentication flow works correctly - users can authenticate and access the dashboard.

- [x] 4. **Finalize Documentation**
    - [x] 4.1 Update the main `spec.md` with a "Completed" status.
    - [x] 4.2 Add a new entry to `development-log.md` summarizing the completion of this spec.
    - [x] 4.3 **Test:** Confirm that all spec documentation is linked and the development log is updated correctly.
