# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Product Library Management System
> Created: 2025-07-31
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive product library management system that allows users to import, search, filter, and manage AV product catalogs through CSV import functionality and an interactive data table interface. This foundational feature will serve as the core product database for quotes, projects, and inventory management throughout the AV management system.

## User Stories

### Product Catalog Import

As an AV business owner, I want to import our master price list from a CSV file, so that I can quickly populate our product database with current pricing and product information without manual data entry.

**Workflow:**
1. User navigates to Product Library page
2. User clicks "Import Products" button
3. User selects CSV file (following the master price sheet format)
4. System validates CSV structure and data
5. User reviews import preview with error/warning summary
6. User confirms import and system processes data
7. System displays import results and updates product count

### Product Search and Discovery

As a sales representative, I want to search and filter products by category and brand, so that I can quickly find the right products for customer quotes and project specifications.

**Workflow:**
1. User enters search terms in the search input
2. User applies filters for category and brand
3. System displays filtered results in a data table
4. User can sort columns and navigate through paginated results
5. User can view product details and access spec sheets/images

### Product Data Management

As a business manager, I want to edit and delete product information inline, so that I can maintain accurate pricing and product details as market conditions change.

**Workflow:**
1. User finds product through search/filter
2. User clicks edit button for inline editing or opens product in modal
3. User modifies product information (price, description, etc.)
4. System validates changes and updates database
5. User can delete obsolete products with confirmation dialog

## Spec Scope

1. **CSV Import System** - Complete import functionality supporting the master price sheet format with validation, preview, and error handling
2. **Product Database Schema** - Supabase table structure supporting all 14 CSV columns with proper indexing for search performance
3. **Advanced Search Interface** - Real-time search with text input and filter dropdowns for category and brand
4. **Data Table Component** - Professional data table with sorting, pagination, and conditional loading (no auto-load)
5. **Inline Editing System** - Edit product information directly in table rows or via modal interface
6. **Product Management** - Delete functionality with proper confirmation and cascade handling

## Out of Scope

- Product image upload/management (will use existing Image URLs from CSV)
- Bulk pricing updates (individual product editing only)
- Product comparison features
- Inventory tracking/quantities
- Vendor/supplier management beyond distributors in CSV
- Product variant/configuration management

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Product Library Page** - Users can import CSV files and see products in a searchable/filterable table
2. **Working Import System** - Master price sheet CSV can be successfully imported with validation and error reporting
3. **Complete CRUD Operations** - Users can create (via import), read (via search/table), update (via inline editing), and delete products
4. **Performance Optimized Search** - Table only loads data after search/filter applied, handles large product catalogs efficiently
