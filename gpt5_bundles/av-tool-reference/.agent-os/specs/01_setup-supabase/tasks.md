# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/01_setup-supabase/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [x] 1. **Initialize Supabase Project**
    - [x] 1.1 Check if Supabase CLI is installed (`supabase -v`). If not, provide installation instructions.
    - [x] 1.2 Navigate into the project directory: `cd software-projects/av-management-tool-v1`.
    - [x] 1.3 Initialize the Supabase project: `supabase init`.
    - [x] 1.4 **Test:** Verify that a `supabase` directory has been created in the project root.

- [x] 2. **Configure Local Environment**
    - [x] 2.1 Create a `.env.local` file in the project root.
    - [x] 2.2 Add `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to the `.env.local` file, leaving the values empty for now.
    - [x] 2.3 Ensure `.env.local` is included in the `.gitignore` file.
    - [x] 2.4 Start the local Supabase services: `supabase start`.
    - [x] 2.5 Copy the `anon key` and `API URL` from the command output into the `.env.local` file.
    - [x] 2.6 **Test:** Confirm that the Supabase services are running locally via Docker (`docker ps`) and that the environment variables have been correctly populated.

- [x] 3. **Create Initial Database Migration**
    - [x] 3.1 Create a new migration file: `supabase migration new initial_schema`.
    - [x] 3.2 Open the newly created SQL file located in `supabase/migrations/`.
    - [x] 3.3 Copy the entire SQL script from `@.agent-os/specs/01_setup-supabase/sub-specs/database-schema.md` into this new migration file.
    - [x] 3.4 Apply the migration to the local database: `supabase db reset`.
    - [x] 3.5 **Test:** Verify that the command completes successfully and use the Supabase Studio UI to confirm the new tables have been created.

- [x] 4. **Implement Supabase Client**
    - [x] 4.1 Create a new directory `src/lib/supabase`.
    - [x] 4.2 Create the client file `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`.
    - [x] 4.3 Implement the singleton Supabase client, ensuring it reads from the environment variables.
    - [x] 4.4 **Test:** Create a temporary test script or modify `src/app/page.tsx` to import the client and perform a simple query (e.g., `select 1`) to confirm the connection works.

- [x] 5. **Finalize Documentation**
    - [x] 5.1 Add the documentation cross-references to the main `spec.md` file.
    - [x] 5.2 Create the `development-log.md` file.
    - [x] 5.3 Add the first entry to the log for the completion of this spec.
    - [x] 5.4 **Test:** Confirm that all spec documentation is linked and the development log is created with the correct first entry.
