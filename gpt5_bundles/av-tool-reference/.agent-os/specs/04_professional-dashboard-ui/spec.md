> Spec: Professional Dashboard UI Enhancement
> Created: 2025-07-31
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Transform the current basic dashboard into a professional, polished interface that matches enterprise-grade AV management software standards. This enhancement will elevate the user experience with a comprehensive navigation system, refined visual design, proper branding, and an organized content structure that supports the full scope of AV management functionality.

## User Stories

### AV Operations Manager

As an AV operations manager, I want a comprehensive dashboard with clear navigation sections in the following order: Dashboard, Leads, Quotes, Projects, Customers, Product Library, Reports, and Settings (at the bottom), so that I can efficiently access all aspects of my AV business management in one unified interface.

The dashboard should present a clean, professional appearance that instills confidence in clients and team members, with organized sections for each major business function and easy access to user account management.

### AV Technician

As an AV technician, I want quick access to project information and customer details through an intuitive sidebar navigation, so that I can rapidly find the information I need while on-site or preparing for installations.

### Business Owner

As an AV business owner, I want a professional-looking dashboard that reflects the quality of my services, so that when clients or partners see the interface, it reinforces my company's professional image and attention to detail.
