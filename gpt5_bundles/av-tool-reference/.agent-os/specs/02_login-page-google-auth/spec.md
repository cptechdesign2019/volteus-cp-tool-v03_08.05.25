> Spec: Login Page with Google Authentication
> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Completed

## Overview

This spec outlines the creation of a modern, professional, and sleek login page. The primary functionality will be to allow users to authenticate securely and seamlessly using their existing Google Workspace accounts via the pre-configured Supabase provider.

## User Stories

### First-Time User

- As a new team member, I want to log in to the application with a single click using my company Google account, so that I can access the tool without needing to create or remember a new password.

### Returning User

- As a returning user, I want a familiar and fast way to access the application, so that I can get to my work quickly.

## Spec Scope

1.  **UI Component:** Design and build a visually appealing login card component.
2.  **Authentication Logic:** Implement the client-side function that calls Supabase's `signInWithOAuth` method for Google.
3.  **Redirect Handling:** Ensure users are redirected to the main dashboard page after a successful login.
4.  **Error Handling:** Display a user-friendly notification if the Google sign-in process fails for any reason.

## Out of Scope

-   Email/password authentication.
-   "Forgot Password" functionality.
-   User registration flows (user profiles are created automatically on first Google sign-in).
-   Server-side OAuth configuration (this is already complete).

## Expected Deliverable

1.  A new page is accessible at the `/login` route.
2.  The page displays a "Sign in with Google" button.
3.  Clicking the button initiates the Google OAuth flow.
4.  Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the application's root (`/`).
