# Page Brief: Projects

> **Phase:** 4
> **Status:** Not Started

## Core Requirements

- **Initial State:**

- **Future Vision:**
  - This will be one of the two most complex pages in the tool.
  - It will be the central hub for managing all aspects of a project after a quote has been accepted.
  - Key functionality will include status tracking (Kanban board), task management, and communication logging.
