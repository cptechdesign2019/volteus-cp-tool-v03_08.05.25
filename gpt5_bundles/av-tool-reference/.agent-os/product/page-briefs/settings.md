# Page Brief: Settings

> **Phase:** 5
> **Status:** Not Started

## Core Requirements

- **Initial State:**
  - For now, this page only requires a placeholder message (e.g., "Settings Page Coming Soon").
- **Future Vision:**
  - This page will be the central location for all user and system configuration.
  - The settings available will be context-aware and dependent on the user's permission level (RBAC).
  - **Standard Users (Sales, Technician):** Can manage their own user profile (e.g., name, notification preferences).
  - **Admins:** Can manage company-level settings (e.g., branding, billing information) and manage other users' accounts and roles.
  - **Super Admin:** Has access to all settings, including system-level configurations.
