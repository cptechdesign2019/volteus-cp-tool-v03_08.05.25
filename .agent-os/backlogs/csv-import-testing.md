# CSV Import Testing Backlog

## Overview
Comprehensive testing plan for the Enhanced Product CSV Importer to ensure reliability and robustness.

## Test Categories

### 1. Column Mapping Tests 🗂️
- [ ] Test CSV with mismatched headers (e.g., "SKU" → "Product ID")
- [ ] Verify smart suggestions appear correctly
- [ ] Test manual column mapping interface
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty headers, special characters)
- [ ] Verify mapping persistence during import flow

### 2. Error Handling Tests 🚨

  - Malformed CSV structure
  - Non-CSV file uploads
  - Files exceeding size limits
- [ ] Authentication/permission issues:
  - Logged out users
  - Insufficient permissions
  - Session timeouts during import

### 3. Performance Tests 📊
- [ ] Large file imports (500+ products)
- [ ] Progress bar accuracy verification
- [ ] Batch processing display correctness
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring with large datasets
- [ ] Network timeout handling
- [ ] Concurrent import attempts

### 4. Duplicate Handling Tests 🔄
- [ ] Import identical products twice
- [ ] Verify UPSERT behavior (updates vs errors)
- [ ] Test which fields get updated on conflict
- [ ] Mixed new/existing product imports
- [ ] Product ID collision scenarios
- [x] Duplicate Product ID within single CSV triggers row-level error and partial success

### 5. Debug Logging Tests 🐛
- [ ] Verify all import attempts are logged
- [ ] Test copy-to-clipboard functionality
- [ ] Confirm 10-log retention limit
- [ ] Download JSON feature testing
- [ ] Log data completeness validation
- [ ] Error scenario logging accuracy
- [x] Mapping info and sample data persisted in logs

### 6. Data Integrity Tests 🗃️
- [ ] Verify all imported data stored correctly
- [ ] Check brand/category dropdowns populate
- [ ] Confirm audit fields (created_by, updated_by)
- [ ] Price formatting and storage validation
- [ ] URL validation and storage
- [ ] Character encoding handling

### 7. User Experience Tests 🎯
- [ ] Upload flow usability
- [ ] Progress feedback clarity
- [ ] Error message helpfulness
- [ ] Success confirmation completeness
- [ ] Mobile/responsive behavior
- [ ] Accessibility compliance

## Priority: Medium
**Status:** Backlogged for future sprint
**Dependencies:** Enhanced CSV importer implementation complete
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours comprehensive testing

## New Backlog Items (2025-08-08)

- [ ] Import valid rows only (toggle when some rows fail)
- [ ] Download error report (CSV/JSON) with row numbers and messages
- [ ] Error dialog enhancements: show summary counts, link to Debug Logs
- [ ] Revisit CSS/spacing for mapping dialog and error states (align with design system)
- [ ] Fix Customers: Edit Customer page not working (open, load, save) — needs full triage and repair
