# Spec Requirements Document - Customer Management System

> **Spec:** Customer Account Management System (Retrospective)  
> **Created:** 2025-01-08  
> **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
> **Implementation Date:** 2025-08-08

## Overview

This retrospective spec documents the comprehensive customer account management system that has been successfully implemented in Volteus. The system provides a professional interface for managing customer accounts with their associated contacts, supports CSV import for existing customer data, and establishes the data relationships needed for future quote creation workflows.

## User Stories (Implemented)

### ✅ Primary User Stories
- ✅ As a user, I can view summary statistics about my customer base (residential vs commercial counts, recent additions) so I can understand my business composition at a glance.
- ✅ As a user, I can search and filter customers without auto-loading all data so the page performs well with large customer databases.
- ✅ As a user, I can click on any customer row to see comprehensive account details in a sidebar so I can quickly review all related information.
- ✅ As a user, I can add, edit, and delete customer accounts with proper validation so I can maintain accurate customer records.
- ✅ As a user, I can import customer data from CSV files so I can migrate existing customer databases efficiently.

### ✅ Business Logic Stories
- ✅ As a user, I am warned before deleting any customer account so I don't accidentally lose important records.
- ✅ As a user, I am prevented from deleting customers with active quotes or projects so I don't lose financial tracking information.
- ✅ As a user, I can manage multiple contacts per customer account so I can maintain relationships with different people at the same company.
