# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/01_customer-management-system/spec.md

> Created: 2025-01-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Database Requirements
- **Customer Accounts Table**: Core account information with JSONB address fields
- **Customer Contacts Table**: One-to-many relationship with customer accounts
- **Full-text Search**: Optimized search across company names and contact names
- **RLS Policies**: Row-level security for multi-tenant data access
- **Audit Fields**: Created/updated timestamps with user tracking

### UI/UX Specifications
- **Conditional Loading**: No data loads until search/filter criteria applied
- **Real-time Search**: Debounced search with 300ms delay for performance
- **Sidebar Drawer**: Right-sliding panel for customer details (400px width)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly table with horizontal scroll
- **Professional Styling**: Clearpoint brand colors and Montserrat typography
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loading and empty state handling

### Integration Requirements
- **CSV Import**: Papa Parse integration with column mapping and validation
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with clear error messaging  
- **Modal Management**: Add/edit customer modals with proper focus management
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints with comprehensive error handling
- **Search Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexing

### Performance Criteria
- **Search Response**: <500ms for filtered customer queries
- **CSV Import**: Handle 1000+ customer records with progress tracking
- **Page Load**: Initial load <2 seconds (without auto-loading data)
- **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large customer datasets

## Approach Options

**Option A: Server-Side Rendering with Conditional Loading** (Selected)
- Pros: Better SEO, faster initial page load, secure data handling
- Cons: Requires careful state management for search functionality
- Performance: Excellent for large datasets

**Option B: Client-Side Data Loading**
- Pros: Smoother user interactions, easier state management
- Cons: Slower initial load, potential security concerns
- Performance: Poor with large customer databases

**Rationale:** Option A provides better scalability and performance for business applications with large customer datasets while maintaining security through server-side data handling.

## External Dependencies

- **@supabase/supabase-js** - Database client and authentication
  - Justification: Provides secure, scalable database access with built-in RLS
- **papaparse** - CSV parsing and processing
  - Justification: Robust CSV handling with error reporting and large file support
- **@tanstack/react-query** - Data fetching and state management
  - Justification: Optimistic updates, caching, and excellent developer experience
- **lucide-react** - Icon library for consistent UI
  - Justification: Lightweight, professional icons with good tree-shaking
- **@radix-ui/react-dialog** - Modal and dialog components
  - Justification: Accessible, unstyled primitives that match our design system

## Component Architecture

### Page Structure
```
customers/page.tsx (Server Component)
├── customer-dashboard.tsx (Client Component)
│   ├── customer-search-bar.tsx
│   ├── customer-table.tsx
│   ├── customer-sidebar.tsx
│   ├── add-customer-modal.tsx
│   ├── edit-customer-modal.tsx
│   └── customer-csv-import-modal.tsx
```

### API Layer
```
lib/api/customers.ts
├── getCustomers() - Search and filter
├── getCustomerById() - Single customer details
├── createCustomer() - Add new customer
├── updateCustomerAccount() - Update account info
├── updateCustomerContact() - Update contact info
├── deleteCustomer() - Soft delete with validation
└── getCustomerStats() - Dashboard statistics
```

### Database Schema Integration
- Follows existing Supabase schema with proper foreign key relationships
- Uses JSONB for flexible address storage
- Implements efficient indexing for search performance
- Maintains data integrity with constraints and validation

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Supabase Auth**: Secure user authentication with session management
- **RLS Policies**: Row-level security ensures users see only their data
- **API Security**: Server-side validation and sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Next.js CSRF protection

### Data Protection
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries through Supabase client
- **XSS Protection**: React's built-in XSS protection with proper escaping
- **Data Encryption**: HTTPS in production with encrypted database storage

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- API functions with mocked Supabase client
- Form validation logic
- Search and filter utilities
- CSV parsing and validation

### Integration Tests
- Customer CRUD operations end-to-end
- CSV import workflow with real data
- Search and filter functionality
- Modal interactions and form submissions

### Performance Tests
- Large dataset handling (1000+ customers)
- Search response times under load
- CSV import with large files
- Memory usage during extended sessions
