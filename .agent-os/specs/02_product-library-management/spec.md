## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Products Table
products (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- Business identifier
  brand TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  product_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  product_number TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  dealer_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  msrp DECIMAL(10,2),
  map_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  primary_distributor TEXT,
  secondary_distributor TEXT,
  tertiary_distributor TEXT,
  spec_sheet_url TEXT,
  image_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by TEXT,
  updated_by TEXT
)
```

### Key Components
- **`src/app/product-library/page.tsx`** - Main product library page
- **`src/components/product-library/product-dashboard.tsx`** - Dashboard with stats and controls
- **`src/components/product-library/add-product-modal.tsx`** - Manual product entry form
- **`src/components/product-library/product-csv-import-modal.tsx`** - CSV import wrapper
- **`src/components/csv/enhanced-product-csv-import.tsx`** - Advanced CSV import component
- **`src/components/csv/product-import-preview.tsx`** - Import preview and validation
- **`src/lib/api/products.ts`** - Product API functions with enhanced validation
- **`src/lib/product-csv-parser.ts`** - Robust CSV parsing with Papa Parse

### Enhanced CSV Import Features
- ✅ **Smart Column Detection**: Suggests mappings for mismatched headers
- ✅ **Manual Mapping Interface**: Dialog for custom column mapping
- ✅ **"Accept All & Continue"**: Auto-fill suggested mappings
- ✅ **Comprehensive Validation**: Field-level validation with detailed errors

## Success Metrics (Achieved)

### ✅ Data Import
- ✅ Successfully imports Todd's 588-product master price sheet
- ✅ Handles real-world CSV formatting issues
- ✅ Provides detailed error reporting for failed rows
- ✅ Processes large files efficiently with progress tracking

### ✅ Performance
- ✅ Conditional loading prevents performance issues with large catalogs
- ✅ Search and filtering respond quickly

- ✅ Intuitive search and filtering
- ✅ Proper error handling and recovery

### ✅ Data Quality
- ✅ Comprehensive validation prevents bad data
- ✅ Proper data type conversion for pricing
- ✅ URL validation for assets
- ✅ Consistent data formatting

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### 1. CSV Import Error Display
**Problem**: Import showed "Complete" when validation failed  
**Solution**: Fixed step logic to check `result.success` before showing completion

### 2. Price Field Validation  
**Problem**: String prices like "89.99" failed validation  
**Solution**: Enhanced `validateProductForAPI` with proper string-to-number conversion

### 3. Column Mapping Issues
**Problem**: CSV headers didn't match expected columns  
**Solution**: Built smart column detection with manual mapping interface

### 4. Service Role Authentication
**Problem**: RLS policies blocked API imports  
**Solution**: Used proper Supabase service role client for import operations

## Integration Points
