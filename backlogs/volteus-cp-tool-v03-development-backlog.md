## 📋 **Feature Backlog**

### 🤖 **HIGH PRIORITY: AI-Enhanced Data Import System**

**Epic**: Replace manual CSV processing with intelligent AI-powered import pipeline

#### **Core Concept**
- **n8n Webhook Integration**: Send raw CSV data to n8n workflow
- **AI Agent Processing**: Let n8n's AI do the heavy lifting for parsing, cleaning, and standardization
- **Consistent Output**: Receive perfectly formatted, validated customer data back
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Handle any CSV format from Monday.com, QuickBooks, X10.AV, etc.

#### **Technical Implementation**
```
User uploads CSV → Volteus sends to n8n webhook → 
AI Agent processes/cleans data → 
Returns standardized JSON → 
Volteus imports to database
```

#### **Features to Implement**
- [ ] **Webhook endpoint creation** in Volteus for receiving processed data
- [ ] **n8n workflow design** with AI agent for CSV processing
- [ ] **File upload to webhook** - stream CSV directly to n8n
- [ ] **AI-powered column mapping** - automatically identify and map any column structure
- [ ] **Intelligent data cleaning** - fix typos, standardize formats, validate data
- [ ] **Smart field extraction** - extract addresses, phone numbers, emails from messy data
- [ ] **Duplicate detection** - AI identifies and merges potential duplicates
- [ ] **Data quality scoring** - AI rates data completeness and accuracy
- [ ] **Error handling & fallback** - graceful degradation to manual processing if AI fails
- [ ] **Processing status tracking** - real-time updates from n8n workflow
- [ ] **Audit trail** - log all AI processing decisions for review

#### **n8n Workflow Components**
- [ ] **HTTP webhook node** - receive CSV from Volteus
- [ ] **AI Text Classifier** - detect CSV format and source system
- [ ] **AI Data Processor** - clean, standardize, and validate data
- [ ] **Data Quality Analyzer** - score and flag potential issues
- [ ] **Response Formatter** - return standardized JSON to Volteus
- [ ] **Error Handler** - manage processing failures

#### **User Experience**
- [ ] **Single-click import** - "Upload CSV and let AI handle the rest"
- [ ] **Progress tracking** - show AI processing stages in real-time
- [ ] **Quality report** - display AI's confidence scores and suggested improvements
- [ ] **Review mode** - allow users to review AI decisions before final import
- [ ] **Batch processing** - handle large files with chunked processing

#### **Success Metrics**
- [ ] **95%+ accuracy** in automatic field mapping
- [ ] **Zero manual column mapping** required for common sources
- [ ] **Sub-30 second processing** for files under 1000 rows
- [ ] **90%+ user satisfaction** with AI processing quality

## 📝 **Notes & Decisions**

### **AI Import System Decision Log**
- **Why n8n?** Provides robust AI processing capabilities with visual workflow design
- **Why webhook approach?** Keeps heavy processing off our main application server
- **Fallback strategy?** Maintain current robust CSV import as backup for AI failures
- **Data privacy?** Process data in secure n8n cloud instance with encryption

### **Architecture Decisions**
- **Supabase Cloud** for scalability and managed infrastructure
- **Next.js App Router** for modern React patterns
- **File-based operations** preferred over terminal commands for transparency
- **Agent OS methodology** for systematic development approach
