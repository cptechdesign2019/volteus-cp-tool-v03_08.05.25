# Volteus Project Development Log

## 2025-07-31 - Initial Setup & Google OAuth Integration

### **Overview**
Successfully established the foundational development environment and implemented a robust Google OAuth login flow for the Volteus project. This included resolving critical build tool conflicts, automating daily development server startup, and meticulously applying the Clearpoint Technology + Design brand guidelines to the login interface.

### **Key Accomplishments**

- **Development Environment Setup:**
  - Analyzed the project codebase through the Agent OS lens to ensure compliance with standards.
  - Resolved persistent `Turbopack` incompatibility issues, explicitly configuring `Webpack` as the default bundler for stability.
  - Automated the daily development server startup process via `start-day.sh`, which now handles dependency installation, stale process termination, background server launch, and terminal auto-titling.

- **Google OAuth Login Flow Implementation:**
  - Implemented a fresh authentication system utilizing Supabase for secure user management.
  - Configured the root page (`/`) to intelligently redirect unauthenticated users to the dedicated `/login` page and authenticated users to `/dashboard`.
  - Designed and developed a new `/login` page from scratch, incorporating the Volteus branding and Clearpoint Technology + Design identity.
  - Eliminated a redundant `/signin` page to streamline the user experience and reduce confusion.
  - Ensured the Supabase authentication callback (`/auth/callback`) correctly defaults to redirecting users to the `/dashboard` upon successful login.
  - Conducted comprehensive testing of the complete OAuth flow to confirm seamless user authentication and redirection.

- **Branding and Styling:**
  - Integrated the **Montserrat** font globally, ensuring consistent and professional typography across the application.
  - Refined the global CSS (`globals.css`) to properly implement Tailwind CSS with custom properties, resolving initial compilation errors related to `@apply` directives.
  - Fully implemented the specified Clearpoint brand color palette:
    - Primary Blues: Navy (`#162944`), Royal (`#203B56`), Indigo/Steel Blue (`#345F94`), Cyan (`#29ABE2`).
    - Neutral Grays: Dark Gray (`#292929`), Medium Gray (`#7A7A7A`), Light Gray (`#CCCCCC`).
    - Accent Color: Amber (`#F4B400`).
  - Applied tasteful amber accents throughout the login interface to enhance visual interest and highlight key elements, while maintaining subtlety as requested.
  - Corrected the login page background to a solid Royal Blue (`#203B56`) as per the final brand specification.

### **Next Steps**

Completed! Proceeding to Dashboard implementation and Monday.com CRM integration.

## 2025-07-31 - Dashboard & Role-Based Navigation Implementation

  - Enabled Row Level Security (RLS) policies for tenant isolation and permission enforcement.
  - Created default "Clearpoint Technology + Design" tenant with proper settings.

- **Dashboard & Navigation System:**
  - Built collapsible sidebar component with royal blue styling (`#203B56`) matching brand guidelines.
  - Implemented responsive design with mobile overlay and hamburger menu functionality.
  - Created role-based navigation structure: Dashboard, Leads, Quotes, Customers, Product Library, Projects, Reporting.
  - Added active route highlighting with amber accent (`#F4B400`) for visual feedback.
  - Integrated user profile display with role and email information.

- **Application Architecture:**
  - Established `(app)` route group for protected dashboard areas.
  - Created app shell layout that handles authentication and user profile loading.
  - Built user profile setup flow for first-time users with role assignment.
  - Updated middleware to protect all dashboard routes and handle redirects.

  - Built placeholder pages for all navigation modules with consistent styling.
  - Implemented smooth transitions and animations for sidebar collapse/expand.
  - Added loading states and proper error handling throughout the application.

### **Technical Implementation**
- Multi-tenant database architecture with proper tenant isolation
- Role-based access control foundation ready for permission enforcement
- Modern UI built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile usage
- Comprehensive documentation in `docs/dashboard-implementation.md`

### **Next Steps**
