# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Foundation & Security
> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Establish the foundational infrastructure and security framework for Volteus, including project setup, CI/CD pipeline, Google SSO authentication, role-based access control, and basic settings management. This spec delivers the secure foundation required for all subsequent feature development.

## User Stories

### Authentication & Access
- *As any User, I want to log in with my Google account so that I don't need another password to remember.*
- *As a Super Admin, I want to control what features each role can access so that sensitive data stays protected.*
- *As a Business Owner, I want all user actions logged so that I can audit system usage if needed.*

### Settings Management
- *As a Super Admin, I want to add new team members and assign their roles so that they can access appropriate system features.*
- *As a Business Owner, I want to update our labor rates seasonally so that quotes reflect current market pricing.*
- *As a Marketing Manager, I want to update email templates so that our client communications match our current branding.*

### Infrastructure
- *As a Developer, I want automated deployments so that code changes reach staging/production reliably.*
- *As a Business Owner, I want the system to be scalable and secure so that we can grow without rebuilding.*

## Spec Scope

### In Scope
1. **Project Infrastructure**
   - GitHub repository setup with branch protection
   - Render.com deployment pipeline (staging + production)
   - Environment variable management
   - Basic monitoring and health checks

2. **Authentication System**
   - Google OAuth 2.0 integration via Supabase Auth
   - Session management with automatic timeout
   - Protected route middleware
   - Login/logout flows

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - User role definitions (Super Admin, Project Manager, Sales, Lead Tech, Technician)
   - Permission-based route protection
   - Role assignment interface for Super Admins
   - Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies

4. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**
   - Tenant isolation via `tenant_id` column
   - RLS policies for data separation
   - Tenant-specific configuration support

5. **Basic Settings Management**
   - Company branding settings (logo, colors, name)
   - Labor rate configuration by role
   - User management interface
   - Basic email template placeholders

6. **Security Features**
   - Audit logging for sensitive actions
   - Password gates for critical pages
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting on auth endpoints

7. **User Interface Specifications**
   - Modern, professional login page adhering to Clearpoint branding
   - Clean, sleek design following `@.agent-os/standards/` guidelines
   - Prominent company name display
   - Google Workspace SSO as primary authentication method
   - Post-login redirect to personalized Dashboard
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile access

## Out of Scope

- Advanced email template editor (basic placeholders only)
- Complex workflow automation
- Advanced reporting/analytics
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- Integration with external services (beyond Google OAuth)
- Advanced backup/restore functionality

## Expected Deliverable

A secure, deployed foundation application with:

1. **Working Authentication**: Users can sign in with Google and are assigned appropriate roles
2. **Protected Dashboard**: Role-based access to different areas of the application
3. **Settings Interface**: Super Admins can manage users, branding, and basic labor rates
4. **Deployment Pipeline**: Code automatically deploys to staging, with production deployment ready
5. **Database Schema**: Core tables for users, roles, tenants, and settings with proper RLS
6. **Security Audit**: Basic security measures tested and verified

### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Google SSO login flow works end-to-end
- ✅ Different user roles see different navigation/features
- ✅ Settings can be updated and persist across sessions
- ✅ Tenant isolation prevents cross-tenant data access
- ✅ Application deploys successfully to Render.com staging
- ✅ All sensitive actions are logged in audit trail
