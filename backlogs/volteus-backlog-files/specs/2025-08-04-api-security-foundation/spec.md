> Spec: API Security Foundation for Todd AV Management Integration
> Created: 2025-08-04
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive API security middleware integration to secure Todd's AV Management business logic with enterprise-grade security infrastructure. This foundation enables safe integration of Todd's sophisticated features while adding authentication, authorization, audit logging, and permission-based access control.

## User Stories

### API Security Integration
As a **system administrator**, I want all of Todd's API endpoints to be protected with Volteus's security middleware, so that sensitive AV management data is secured with authentication, authorization, and audit logging.

**Detailed Workflow**:
1. Developer wraps Todd's existing API routes with Volteus `withPermissions()` middleware
2. System automatically validates user authentication and role permissions
3. All API calls are logged to audit trail with user context and actions
4. Rate limiting prevents abuse and protects system resources
5. User-level access control ensures appropriate data access based on roles

### Permission-Based Feature Access
As a **business user**, I want my access to AV management features to be controlled by my role permissions, so that I only see and can modify data appropriate to my job function.

**Detailed Workflow**:
1. User authenticates via Google OAuth and has assigned role (technician, sales_rep, etc.)
2. Each API request checks user permissions against required feature permissions
3. Users with insufficient permissions receive clear access denied messages
4. System maintains audit log of all permission checks and access attempts

### Audit Trail for Business Operations
As a **business owner**, I want all AV management operations to be logged with user context, so that I can track who made changes to customers, quotes, and projects for compliance and accountability.

**Detailed Workflow**:
1. All business operations (customer creation, quote updates, project changes) are logged
2. Audit logs include user ID, action taken, resource affected, timestamp, and IP address
3. Logs are searchable and filterable for compliance reporting
4. Critical business actions are flagged for enhanced monitoring

## Spec Scope

1. **API Middleware Integration** - Wrap all Todd's API endpoints with Volteus `withPermissions()` security middleware
2. **Permission Mapping System** - Map Todd's 4-role hierarchy to Volteus's granular permission system
3. **Audit Logging Implementation** - Add comprehensive audit logging to all business operations and data access
4. **Rate Limiting Protection** - Apply rate limiting to prevent API abuse and resource exhaustion
5. **Error Handling Enhancement** - Implement consistent security-aware error responses across all endpoints

## Out of Scope

- UI changes or page modifications (handled in separate UI integration spec)
- Database schema changes (preserve Todd's existing single-tenant schema)
- Business logic modifications (preserve Todd's existing functionality)
- Authentication flow changes (Volteus auth system already established)
- Multi-tenant architecture (single-tenant focus for initial implementation)
- Performance optimization (focus on security first, optimize later)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Secured API Endpoints** - All Todd's API routes protected with authentication, authorization, and rate limiting
2. **Permission-Based Access Control** - Users can only access AV management features appropriate to their role
3. **Comprehensive Audit Trail** - All business operations logged with user context for compliance and accountability
4. **Security Testing Validation** - Automated tests verify security middleware works correctly for all user roles and permission scenarios
