  - [ ] 7.6 Validate error handling consistency and security
  - [ ] 7.7 Perform performance testing of security overhead
  - [ ] 7.8 Verify all security requirements are met and documented

## Implementation Notes

### Task Dependencies
- **Task 1** must be completed before other tasks (foundation)
- **Task 2** provides infrastructure for Tasks 3-6
- **Tasks 3-6** can be implemented in parallel after Tasks 1-2
- **Task 7** requires completion of all previous tasks

### Testing Strategy
- Each major task starts with comprehensive test writing (TDD approach)
- Tests must pass before moving to next task
- Security tests cover all user roles and permission scenarios
- Performance tests validate acceptable overhead levels

### Quality Gates
- All endpoints must have authentication and authorization
- All business operations must generate audit logs
- All error responses must follow consistent format
- All security tests must achieve >90% coverage

### Security Priority
- Authentication and authorization are non-negotiable requirements
- Rate limiting must be applied to prevent abuse
- Audit logging is required for compliance
- User-level access control must be verified for all operations
- Todd's existing database schema and business logic must be preserved
