### **Volteus Backlog Files** (`volteus-backlog-files/`)
- `development-progress.md` - Implementation progress tracking
- `development-log.md` - Development history and accomplishments
- `START_HERE.md` - Project overview and setup instructions
- `dev.log` - Brief development notes
- `specs/` - Detailed Agent OS specifications:
  - `2025-08-04-api-security-foundation/`
